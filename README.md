# Automatic-Hang-Rigging-with-Maya
### About the Project:
This script will automatically rig a skeleton with FK controls within the Maya interface. If you select the first joint on each finger, it will set up the controls for you, including a finger spread and curl feature. This project was written in Python and makes use of the MEL commands.
